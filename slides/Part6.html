<h2>Changing masters</h2>

<p>
The presentations I give tend to be constructed as a series of chapters or
parts. If all the slides look the same, however, it can be difficult for 
the audience to appreciate that the topic has changed. One way to approach this
is to use a distinct visual style of the set of slides making up the chapter.

Before I gave this presentation to an audience of students, I asked the
organizers if there were any themes they wanted me to cover in particular.
They told me that there was a lot of confusion about the different approaches
to open soure. Without getting into a licencing debate (which would have been
incomprehensible and obtuse) I discussed some differences in people's
philisophical approach to software freedom.

<h1>About lists</h1>

<p>
Everyone hates boring slides with nothing but bullet point lists. And yet
almost every presentation you see ends up having boring lists of bullet
points. Death by PowerPoint.

<p>
The problem with lists is that there is no distinction between the individual
items; it's just a continuous undifferentiated visual block.

<p>
If you do have to drop a list on people, what can you do to make it
interesting? The next two slides offer an example. The first is what <i>not</i>
to do; the second one shows what Projection's default theme offers to help;
bumping the size up is also a good idea.

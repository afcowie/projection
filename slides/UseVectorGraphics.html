<h2>
Illustrating with Vector Graphics
</h2>

<p>
I create a lot of custom graphics to illustrate things in my presentations.
Using Microsoft PowerPoint / OpenOffice Impress / LibreOffice Impress you of
course have the built in drawing tools, and that’s something you have to
replace if you’re not using WhateverPoint. That’s not actually a problem.
Vector graphics? Well, that’s what SVGs are for, and we’re blessed to have the
ever fantastic Inkscape to compose them.

<p>
I do almost all the bodies of my slides as SVG images using Inkscape, so a
major criterion for me when implementing yet-another-presentation-system was
facilitating good support for SVG. Most of the time you want your illustration
centered so in Projection this is done horizontally and vertically if the
media element has class "graphic".

<h1>Welcome to Projection</h1>


<p>
This slide deck was the primary test case that I used while developing
Projection.
</p>

<p>
It's primary purpose is to test various edge cases, but to make it
other than entirely contrived its visual elements are adapted from a
presentation I gave as the invited speaker at <i>Mukthi '07</i>, the annual
conference run by the Linux User Group at the MS Ramaiah Institute of
Technology at Bangalore, India.  Pretty damn cool that the Mathematics,
Computer Science, and Engineering faculty there supports their own LUG.
</p>

<p>
This slide is actually a comment; indeed, you wouldn't ordinarily expect this
much text on a slide; it's not like anyone in the audience would be able to
read it.
</p>

<p>
Comment slides are not for display when you're delivering the presentation
live; rather, they're meant to help people reading your presentation on the web
after the fact <i>(in a future version of Projection I'd like to find a way for
slides marked with the “comment” class to be excluded. That's a TODO for
now).</i>

<h1>Welcome to Projection</h1>


<p>
This is the example I used while developing my HTML-based presentation tool.
</p>

<p>
It's original purpose was to test various edge cases, but to make it
other than entirely contrived its visual elements are now adapted from a
presentation I gave as the invited speaker at <i>Mukthi '07</i>, the annual
conference run by the Linux User Group at the MS Ramaiah Institute of
Technology at Bangalore, India. Pretty damn cool that the university's
Mathematics, Computer Science, and Engineering faculty supports their own LUG
and encourages students to participate.

<p>
This slide is actually a <b>comment</b>; indeed, you wouldn't ordinarily expect this
much text on a slide; it's not like anyone in the audience would be able to
read it.
</p>

<p>
Comment slides are not for display when you're delivering the presentation
live; rather, they're meant to help people reading your presentation on the web
after the fact <i>(in a future version of Projection I'd like to find a way for
slides marked with the “comment” class to be excluded. That's a TODO for
now).</i>
